# Configuring PCI Passthrough in OpenStack

PCI Passthrough in OpenStack allows you to assign physical PCI devices directly to virtual machine instances, enabling high-performance access to hardware resources such as GPUs and network cards. This guide walks you through the basic steps to configure PCI Passthrough.

## Enable IOMMU on Compute Nodes

An Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) is essential in computing for connecting a Direct Memory Access (DMA)-capable I/O bus to the main memory. Like a traditional Memory Management Unit (MMU), which translates CPU-visible virtual addresses to physical addresses, the IOMMU maps device-visible virtual addresses (also called device addresses or memory-mapped I/O addresses) to physical addresses. Additionally, IOMMUs provide memory protection, preventing issues caused by faulty or malicious devices. This functionality is critical for enabling secure and efficient PCI Passthrough in OpenStack environments.

### For Intel CPUs

1. Edit the GRUB configuration file:

``` shell
sudo vi /etc/default/grub
```

2. Add `intel_iommu=on` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` line:

``` shell
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_iommu=on"
```

### For AMD CPUs

1. Edit the GRUB configuration file:

``` shell
sudo vi /etc/default/grub
```

2. Add `amd_iommu=on` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` line:

``` shell
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash amd_iommu=on"
```

## Identify PCI Devices

Identify the PCI devices you want to passthrough using the `lspci` command:

``` shell
lspci -knn | grep NVIDIA
```

!!! example "lspci output"

    ``` shell
    0b:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GP106GL [Quadro P2000] [10de:1c30] (rev a1)
    0b:00.1 Audio device [0403]: NVIDIA Corporation GP106 High Definition Audio Controller [10de:10f1] (rev a1)
    ```

From the example output, we can see that we have two devices that we'll want to be able to pass through to our instances; we'll need to note `10de:1c30` and `10de:10f1` for use in the host configuration.

### Add VFIO Configuration


1. Edit the GRUB configuration file:

``` shell
sudo vi /etc/default/grub
```

2. Modify the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` once again, extending it for `vfio-pci.ids`.

``` shell
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="... vfio-pci.ids=10de:1c30,10de:10f1"
```

!!! note

    The value of `vfio-pci.ids` is the same as the noted from the *lspci output*.

### Update GRUB and reboot

``` shell
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

## Validate the setup

Once the node has been rebooted, check the `lspci` output to ensure that the device being used as passthrough is using the `vfio-pci` driver.

Re-identify the PCI devices you want to passthrough using the `lspci` command

``` shell
lspci -knn | grep NVIDIA
```

!!! example "lspci output"

    ``` shell
    ...
    0b:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP106GL [Quadro P2000] (rev a1)
            Subsystem: Dell GP106GL [Quadro P2000]
            Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
            Kernel modules: nouveau
    0b:00.1 Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation GP106 High Definition Audio Controller (rev a1)
            Subsystem: Dell GP106 High Definition Audio Controller
            Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
            Kernel modules: snd_hda_intel
    ...
    ```

Note the "Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci" section. If the kernel driver is anything other than `vfio-pci` you many need to blacklist the referenced driver before you continue. See the following docs on how to [blacklist a kernel module](https://wiki.debian.org/KernelModuleBlacklisting).

## Configure Nova Compute

With the same `lspci` information used in the `vfio` setup, create a `device_spec` and `alias` in JSON string format. The `device_spec` needs the **vendor_id** and **product_id** which are within our known PCI information. For `10de:1c30` and `10de:10f1`, the left side of the `:` is the **vendor_id** and the right side is the **product_id**.

| vendor_id | product_id |
| --------- | ---------- |
|   10de    |    1c30    |
|   10de    |    10f1    |

### Example `device_spec`

``` json
{"vendor_id": "10de", "product_id": "1c30"}
```

### Example `alias`

``` json
{"vendor_id": "10de", "product_id": "1c30", "device_type": "type-PCI", "name": "p2000"}
```

1. See the [Genestack service override documentation](openstack-service-overrides.md) on how update your compute infrastructure to use the `device_spec` and `alias`.

1. Create a custom flavor which has your alias name as a property. See the [Genestack flavor documentation](openstack-flavors.md) on how to craft custom flavors.

## Launch an Instance with PCI Passthrough

1. Verify that the instance has the PCI device assigned. SSH into the instance and use the `lspci` command:

``` shell
lspci | grep -i nvidia
```

!!! example "lspci output"

    ``` shell
    06:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP106GL [Quadro P2000] (rev a1)
    ```

Assuming this is running an NVIDIA GPU, you can run install the relevant drivers and run the `nvidia-smi` command to validate everything is running normally.

``` shell "Example nvidia GPU running in a VM"

## Common Issues

- **Device Not Found:** Ensure the PCI device is available and not used by the host.
- **Configuration Errors:** Check `nova-compute` logs.
- **IOMMU Not Enabled:** Confirm that IOMMU is enabled in the BIOS/UEFI and in the GRUB configuration.

## Conclusion

Configuring PCI Passthrough in OpenStack enhances the performance of virtual machines by providing direct access to physical hardware.
