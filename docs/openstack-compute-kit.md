# Create Compute Kit

The Compute Kit in OpenStack encompasses critical services that power the computational infrastructure of a cloud environment.

* **Nova** is the compute service that manages and orchestrates the lifecycle of virtual machines (VMs), handling tasks such as instance creation, scheduling, and termination.
* **Neutron** provides the networking service, enabling flexible network connectivity and addressing within the cloud, including support for complex networking configurations like VLANs, VXLANs, and advanced routing.
* **Placement** is a resource tracking service that ensures optimal allocation of compute, storage, and network resources across the cloud.

Together, Nova, Neutron, and Placement form the backbone of the OpenStack Compute Kit, enabling the efficient and scalable operation of cloud instances. In this document, we will explore how these services can be deployed using Genestack.
