# TopoLVM - In Cluster

[TopoLVM](https://github.com/topolvm/topolvm) is a capacity aware storage provisioner which can make use of physical volumes.

The following steps are one way to set it up, however, consult the [documentation](https://github.com/topolvm/topolvm/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) for a full breakdown of everything possible with TopoLVM.

## Create the target volume group on your hosts

TopoLVM requires access to a volume group on the physical host to work, which means we need to set up a volume group on our hosts. By default, TopoLVM will use the controllers as storage hosts. The genestack Kustomize solution sets the general storage volume group to `vg-general`. This value can be changed within Kustomize found at `kustomize/topolvm/general/kustomization.yaml`.

!!! example "Simple example showing how to create the needed volume group"

    ``` shell
    # NOTE sdX is a placeholder for a physical drive or partition.
    pvcreate /dev/sdX
    vgcreate vg-general /dev/sdX
    ```

Once the volume group is on your storage nodes, the node is ready for use.

### Deploy the TopoLVM Provisioner

``` shell
kubectl kustomize --enable-helm /etc/genestack/kustomize/topolvm/general | kubectl apply -f -
```
