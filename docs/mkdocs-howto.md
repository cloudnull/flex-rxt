# Working on docs locally

To work on documentation locally and preview it while developing, we can use `mkdocs serve`

Start by installing the requirements for documentation.

``` shell
pip install -r doc-requirements.txt
```

!!! tip

    You may want to first create a virtualenv and install requirements in there.

Once the installation is done, run the mkdocs server locally to view your changes.

``` shell
cd genestack/
mkdocs serve
```
