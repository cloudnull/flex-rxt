# Swift Object Store

## Goal

Use the command-line utility `swift` to perform operations on your object store.

## Requirements

For a more detailed explanation of any specific command, add `--help` after it:

``` shell
swift list --help
```

!!! example

    ``` shell
    $ swift list --help

    Usage: swift list [--long] [--lh] [--totals] [--prefix <prefix>]
                      [--delimiter <delimiter>] [--header <header:value>]
                      [--versions] [<container>]

    Lists the containers for the account or the objects for a container.

    Positional arguments:
      [<container>]           Name of container to list object in.

    Optional arguments:
      -l, --long            Long listing format, similar to ls -l.
      --lh                  Report sizes in human readable format similar to
                            ls -lh.
      -t, --totals          Used with -l or --lh, only report totals.
      -p <prefix>, --prefix <prefix>
                            Only list items beginning with the prefix.
      -d <delim>, --delimiter <delim>
                            Roll up items with the given delimiter. For containers
                            only. See OpenStack Swift API documentation for what
                            this means.
      -j, --json            Display listing information in json
      --versions            Display listing information for all versions
      -H, --header <header:value>
                            Adds a custom request header to use for listing.
    ```

### Create an object container

Create the container named "flex-container01":
``` shell
swift post flex-container01
```

If you like, make the container public:
``` shell
swift post --header "X-Container-Read: .r:*" flex-container01
```

Verify the container's configuration:
``` shell
swift stat flex-container01
```

!!! example

    FIXME: Example coming soon!

### Upload files to the container

Upload the entire contents of a folder to the container:
``` shell
swift upload flex-container01 example-files/
```

!!! example

    ``` shell
    $ swift upload flex-container01 example-files/
    example-docs/readme.md
    example-docs/image01.jpg
    example-docs/image02.png
    ```

Uploading an entire folder will add that prefix to your filenames inside the container.
``` shell
swift list flex-container01
```

!!! example

    ``` shell
    $ swift list flex-container01
    example-docs/readme.md
    example-docs/image01.jpg
    example-docs/image02.png
    document01.rtf
    document02.rtf
    ```

Filter the display of files only with the prefix by using the `--prefix` argument:
``` shell
swift list flex-container01 --prefix example-docs
```

!!! example

    ``` shell
    $ swift list flex-container01 --prefix example-docs
    example-docs/readme.md
    example-docs/image01.jpg
    example-docs/image02.png
    ```

### Downloading files
When the container is public, you can access each file using a specific URL, made up of your region's endpoint, the name of your container, the prefix (if any) of your object, and finally, the object name.
``` shell
<REGIONAL_ENDPOINT>/v1/AUTHxxx/flex-container01/example-docs/readme.md
```

Using the swift client to download a single file:
``` shell
swift download flex-container01 document01.rtf
```

Using the swift client to download multiple files with the same prefix:
``` shell
swift download flex-container01 --prefix example-docs
```

### Deleting containers or objects
``` shell
swift delete flex-container01 document01.rtf
```

!!! example

    ``` shell
    $ swift delete flex-container01 document01.rtf
    document01.rtf
    ```

Similar to downloading, you can delete multiple files with the same prefix:
``` shell
swift delete flex-container01 example-docs/*
```

!!! example

    ``` shell
    $ swift delete flex-container01 example-docs/*
    example-docs/readme.md
    example-docs/image01.jpg
    example-docs/image02.png
    ```

Deleting a container:
``` shell
swift delete flex-container01
```

!!! example

    ``` shell
    $ swift delete flex-container01
    document01.rtf
    document02.rtf
    ```

Deleting a container will delete all files in the container.

### Setting and removing object expiration
Swift objects can be scheduled to expire by setting either the `X-Delete-At` or `X-Delete-After` header.

Once the object expires, swift will no longer serve the object, and it will be deleted.

#### Expire at a specific time
Obtain the current Unix epoch timestamp by running `date +%s`.

Set an object to expire at an absolute Unix epoch timestamp:
``` shell
swift post flex-container01 document01.rtf -H "X-Delete-At:UNIX_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP"
```

!!! example

    ``` shell
    $ swift post flex-container01 document01.rtf -H "X-Delete-At:1711732649"
    ```

Verify the header has been applied to the object:
``` shell
swift stat flex-container01 document01.rtf
```

#### Expire after a number of seconds
Set an object to expire after a relative amount of time, in seconds:
``` shell
swift post flex-container01 document01.rtf -H "X-Delete-After:SECONDS"
```

!!! example

    ``` shell
    $ swift post flex-container01 document01.rtf -H "X-Delete-After:42"
    ```

The `X-Delete-After` header will be converted to `X-Delete-At`.

Verify the header has been applied to the object:
``` shell
swift stat flex-container01 document01.rtf
```

#### Remove the expire header
If you no longer want the object to expire, you can remove the `X-Delete-At` header:
``` shell
swift post flex-container01 document01.rtf -H "X-Delete-At:"
```
