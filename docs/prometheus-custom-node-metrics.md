# Deploy Custom Metrics

We can utilize the Node Exporter deployed by Prometheus to collect custom metrics that may not be available from other exporters.

For more information visit: [Node Exporter Textfile Collectors](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter?tab=readme-ov-file#textfile-collector)

You can also view example scripts here: [Textfile Collector Scripts](https://github.com/prometheus-community/node-exporter-textfile-collector-scripts)


#### Example custom exporter playbook

``` shell
ansible-playbook custom_exporters.yml
```

#### Example custom exporter playbook with overrides

Confirm openstack-flex-inventory.yaml matches what is in /etc/genestack/inventory. If it does not match update the command to match the file names.

``` shell
# Example overriding things on the CLI
ansible-playbook custom_exporters.yml --inventory /etc/genestack/inventory/openstack-flex-inventory.yaml \
                                --private-key ${HOME}/.ssh/openstack-flex-keypair.key
```

Once the scripts run the node exporter will collect your metrics and supply them to prometheus for you to view.
