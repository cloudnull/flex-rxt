    1. The genesis of cloud
    2. Open-Infrastructure Simplified
    3. Your new favorite OpenStack ecosystem

Genestack — where Kubernetes and OpenStack tango in the cloud. Imagine a waltz between systems that deploy
what you need. Operators play the score, managing the complexity with a flick of their digital batons. They
unify the chaos, making scaling and management a piece of cake. Think of it like a conductor effortlessly
guiding a cacophony into a symphony.

## What is Genestack?

this project is to allow hobbyists, operators, and cloud service providers the ability to build, scale, and
