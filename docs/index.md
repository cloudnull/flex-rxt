# Welcome to the Genestack Documentation

Genestack â€” where Kubernetes and OpenStack tango in the cloud. Imagine a waltz between systems that deploy
what you need. Operators play the score, managing the complexity with a flick of their digital batons. They
unify the chaos, making scaling and management a piece of cake. Think of it like a conductor effortlessly
guiding a cacophony into a symphony.
