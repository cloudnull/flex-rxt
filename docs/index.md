# Welcome to the Genestack Documentation

Genestack â€” where Kubernetes and OpenStack tango in the cloud. Imagine a waltz between systems that deploy
what you need. Operators play the score, managing the complexity with a flick of their digital batons. They
unify the chaos, making scaling and management a piece of cake. Think of it like a conductor effortlessly
guiding a cacophony into a symphony.

## Environment Architecture

Genestack is making use of some homegrown solutions, community operators, and OpenStack-Helm. Everything
in Genestack comes together to form cloud in a new and exciting way; all built with opensource solutions
to manage cloud infrastructure in the way you need it.

They say a picture is worth 1000 words, so here's a picture.
