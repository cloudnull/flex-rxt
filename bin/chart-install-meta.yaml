# This files generally tries to match the naming conventions for a
# kustomization.yaml with `helmCharts`. helmCharts sometimes has 'includeCRDs'
# in it, but `helm install` includes CRDs unless you specify `--skip-crds`, so
# that doesn't appear here.
#
# Using 'helm' commands to add a repo, like `helm repo add`, gives the repo a
# name. No analog exists in a kustomization.yaml under `helmCharts`, but here,
# you also specify a repoName which appears as the name in `helm repo list`.
